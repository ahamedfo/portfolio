export const aboutText = `I'm a software engineer passionate about the intersection of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Currently pursuing my MS in Cybersecurity at NYU, I bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI research and practical security applications.

My work spans from researching threat actor ecosystems using NLP techniques to preparing for building enterprise AI solutions at IBM this summer. I believe the future of security lies in intelligent systems that can adapt and respond to emerging threats in real-time.`
